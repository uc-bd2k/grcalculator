    <h4>File types (.csv or .tsv)</h4>

<p>Input files may be either comma- or tab-separated text files (.csv or .tsv).</p>

<h4>Necessary columns</h4>

<p>The first line in the input file needs to contain column names that exactly match those in our example files.</p>

<h5>Metadata columns: <font color="blue">1) cell_line &emsp; 2) treatment &emsp; 3) concentration </font></h5>

<p>The columns "cell_line", "treatment", and "concentration" are always required, but you may also have other metadata columns. For example, <a href = "https://github.com/uc-bd2k/grcalculator/blob/master/resources/Heiser_al_GRmetrics_wSubType_Taxol.tsv">this dataset</a> from Heiser et al.<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1018854108"><sup>[3]</sup></a></sup> contains column for clinical subtype (HR+, Her2amp, etc.) and molecular subtypes (Luminal, Basal, etc.). </p>

<h5>Cell count columns: <font color="blue">1) cell_count &emsp; 2) cell_count__ctrl &emsp; 3) cell_count__time0</font></h5>

<p>In the simplest case, the GR metrics method requires only live cell counts, or some surrogate of cell count such as cell-titer glo. We require end-of-assay counts for cells at each treated concentration <b>("cell_count")</b> as well as end-of-assay counts of corresponding un-treated cells <b>("cell_count__ctrl")</b> and beginning-of-assay counts <b>("cell_count__time0")</b>. The control and beginning-of-assay counts may be repeated as necessary.
</p>
<p><b>Note that "cell_count__ctrl" and "cell_count__time0" have one underscore between "cell" and "count", and two underscores after "count".</b></p>
<p>You may find an example dataset <a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uc-bd2k/grcalculator/update/resources/caseA_example.csv">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The formatting above is recommended, but if you prefer, you may format your input data with only one column per line for cell counts <b>(Case B)</b>. In this case, only the <b>"cell_count"</b> column should be included <b>(no "cell_count__ctrl" or "cell_count__time0" columns)</b>. Un-treated measurements should be indicated by a dash "-" in the <b>"treatment"</b> column and a "0" in the <b>"concentration"</b> column. A <b>"treatment_duration__hrs"</b> column must be included <b>(two underscores after "duration")</b>, with "0" indicating measurements at the beginning of the assay and a number of hours (e.g. "72" for a 3-day assay) for measurements at the end of the assay.</p>
<p>You may find example datasets with this formatting for the case where one has <a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uc-bd2k/grcalculator/update/resources/caseB_example.csv">initial cell counts</a> or where one instead has estimates of <a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uc-bd2k/grcalculator/update/resources/caseB_div_example.csv">cell division time</a>.</p>

        Using un-treated cell division time instead of initial cell count

    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <font size="3">
        <p>The purpose of measuring cell count at the beginning of the assay is to allow for estimation of growth-rates of
          treated and un-treated cells. In place of this measurement you may separately measure the growth-rate of each
          (un-treated) cell line.</p>
        <p>In this case, you may swap the <b>"cell_count__time0"</b> column with two columns:
          <b>"treatment_duration__hrs"</b> – the length of the assay (in hours), and <b>"division_time"</b> - the number
          of hours it takes cells from each (untreated) cell line to double in population.</p>
        <p><b>Note that "cell_count__ctrl" and "cell_count__time0" have one underscore between "cell" and "count", and two

<p>To illustrate the utility and convenience of the GR Calculator and show a real-world example of its usage, we will walk through a quick analysis of the response of breast cancer cell lines to taxol as measured by Heiser et al. (2012)<sup>1</sup>. To access the GR Calculator from the homepage, click “Online GR Calculator” in the top banner or click the middle image (“Upload and analyze your own data”). This will bring you to the GR Calculator application where you can input and analyze drug response datasets.</p>
<center>

</div>
<div id="gr-calculator" class="section level2">
<h2>GR Calculator</h2>
<p>In the middle of the page you will find instructions on how to format input files. There are two acceptable formats described. The data for this example is in Format A. The required columns for this format are listed in the instructions: the concentration of the drug, the cell count at the time of treatment, and cell counts of the treated and control samples at the end of the treatment. These columns must be named “concentration”, “cell_count__time0”, “cell_count”, and “cell_count__ctrl”, respectively. Any additional column, such as drug, cell line, or replicate, is considered a grouping variable. You may use either a comma-separated file (.csv) or a tab-delimited file (.tsv) for input. The dataset used in this example can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uc-bd2k/grcalculator/master/resources/Heiser_al_GRmetrics_wSubType_Taxol.tsv" class="uri">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uc-bd2k/grcalculator/master/resources/Heiser_al_GRmetrics_wSubType_Taxol.tsv</a></p>
<center>
</center>
<div id="data-input" class="section level3">
<h3>Data input</h3>
<p>To get started, click “Open data file” and select “Tab” as a separator (our file is tab-delimited). You may either paste the URL from above into the text box and click the “Fetch Data” button, or if you downloaded the data, you may click the “Browse…” button and select the file you just downloaded. This dataset contains experimental data of the response of breast cancer cell lines to the microtubule stabilizer taxol as measured by Heiser et al. (2012)<sup>1</sup>. The data file also contains the clinical subtypes (HER2amp for HER2 amplified, HR+ for hormone receptor positive, NM for non-malignant, TNBC for Triple negative breast cancer, and Unknown for Unknown subtype) and transcriptional subtypes (Basal, Luminal, etc.) for each cell line. Taxol has been shown to be effective in patients with either HER2 positive or TNBC cancers<sup>3,4,5</sup>, so we would expect it to have a stronger effect in the HER2 amplified and TNBC cell lines than in the ones of other subtypes. This difference should be reflected by lower values of the sensitivity metrics IC50 and GR50 for the HER2amp and TNBC cell lines. After analyzing the data, we will visualize these differences using the tools developed here.</p>
<center>
</center>
</div>
<div id="data-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Data analysis</h3>
<p>Now, once the dataset is loaded (Fig. 3), remove “BiolReplicate” from the “Select grouping variables” box by clicking on it and pressing the “delete” key. Removing grouping variables tells the calculator to average over those unselected variables; here we decided to average the biological replicates. Click the “Analyze” button to perform the curve fitting and calculate the GR and traditional metrics. This populates the “GR Values” and “Fitted Parameters” data tables and creates three new tabs: “Dose-Response by Condition”, “Dose-Response Grid”, and “GR Metric Comparison”.</p>
</div>
<div id="dose-response-by-condition-tab" class="section level3">
<h3>Dose-Response by Condition tab</h3>
<p>The “Dose-Response by Condition” tab contains the fitted GR curves for each condition (Fig. 4). You may select any combination of values for each grouping variable to choose which curves you would like to see. The x-axis is the log (base 10) of concentration; the y-axis is either the GR value or relative cell count, depending on whether you select GR or IC as “curve type”. In the figure, we have selected “HER2amp” and “TNBC” clinical subtypes, “Basal A” transcriptional type, and of course “Taxol” as the drug. Leaving the “CellLine” box empty automatically selects all cell lines. For datasets with many conditions, the “Dose-Response Grid” tab allows to quickly view many curves at once in a grid format (Fig. 5). You can choose between the GR and traditional (IC) curves. The first drop-down menu at the top, “Choose selector variable”, controls which values can be selected to highlight samples on the grid. The second selection box at the top, “Choose grid variables”, allows the user to choose which grouping variables define the grid. In the figure, we chose the combination of clinical and transcriptional subtypes to define the grid and we chose cell lines as the variable for highlighting samples; in the box on the left we picked a few specific cell lines.</p>
<center>

</div>
<div id="dose-response-grid-tab" class="section level3">
<h3>Dose-Response Grid tab</h3>
<p>For datasets with many conditions, the “Dose-Response Grid” tab allows to quickly view many curves at once in a grid format (Fig. 5). Again, you can choose between the GR and traditional (IC) curves. The first selection box at the top, “Choose selector variable”, controls what can be selected from the box to the left. When selected, curves that match values in this box will be highlighted in different colors on the grid. The second selection box at the top allows the user to choose which grouping variables define the grid. In the figure, we have chosen the combination of clinical and transcriptional subtypes to define the grid and we have selected many cell lines in the box on the left as an example.</p>
<center>
</center>
</div>
<div id="gr-metric-comparison-tab" class="section level3">
<h3>GR Metric Comparison tab</h3>
<p>The tab “GR Metric Comparison” displays boxplots or scatter plots based on the GR or traditional metrics (Fig. 6). The boxplots can be particularly useful for comparing the potency or efficacy of a drug across many different conditions. The top selection box, “Select parameter”, allows you to choose the metric you would like to use (y-axis). The next selection box, “Select grouping variable”, allows you to specify the variable (e.g. clinical subtype) that will determine which values define the boxplots. By default up to ten boxplots are shown, but the user can select and de-select boxplots. Additionally, one may perform a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess if the values from one boxplot (or a set of boxplots) are significantly different from the ones from another boxplot or set of boxplots.</p>
<p>Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the GR<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>50</sub> across the four clinical subtypes in the data (excluding “Unknown”). As stated before, we expect that values for the TNBC and HER2amp cell lines will be significantly less than those of the other clinical subtypes. After selecting “GR50” as our metric, we select “ClinSubtype” for the grouping variable and the point coloring, and we choose to compare “HER2amp” and “TNBC” cell lines against “HR+” and “NM” cell lines. By the p-value of 0.042, we can see that this group (“HER2amp” and “TNBC”) seems to have significantly lower GR50 values than the other clinical subtypes, as expected.</p>
<center>
</center>
<p>After verifying that taxol is most potent on HER2amp and TNBC cell lines as measured by GR<sub>50</sub> values, we explore whether this result is the same using the traditional dose-response metric, IC<sub>50</sub>. To do this, we simply change our parameter selection to “IC50”. As shown in Figure 7, the p-value is 0.42, indicating no significant difference in the toxicity of taxol between the two groups of clinical subtypes. From this example we see that the GR Calculator and the underlying GR value method is useful for detecting differences that can be hidden when using IC<sub>50</sub> values, as traditional metrics are confounded by differences in division rates<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<center>
</center>
<p>Most plots are interactive and will show extra information dynamically. For example, hovering over points and curves in the “Dose-Response by Condition” tab will display the GR value or relative cell count and corresponding concentration. In the “GR Metric Comparison” tab, hovering over a boxplot will display the maximum, minimum, and median values. The user can also hover over individual points in the boxplot and scatter plot visualizations to see detailed information. In addition, the user can adjust the plot height, zoom in, and download the figure in pdf or tiff format.</p>

        inhibition is given by the ratio of the growth-rate of the treated cells <b><i>k(c)</i></b> to that of the untreated
        cells <b><i>k(0)</i></b>. We normalize this ratio by exponentiating it and subtracting one so that it falls between -1
        and 1 for growth-inhibiting and cytotoxic treatments.

        <p>
          Because it is difficult to measure the growth-rate at any one time, we use the starting population and endpoint
          measures to estimate the average growth-rate throughout the experiment. Using the definitions above, we can calculate the growth-rate of the un-treated
          control as

        <p>
          The GR value relates naturally to a treatment's effects on cell population growth. For partially cytostatic treatments (where growth is slowed, but not completely halted) GR values fall between 1 and 0. A GR value of zero represents cytostasis, or completely halted population growth. Cytotoxic treatments (where cell population declines) produce GR values between 0 and -1. Finally, a GR value of greater than one signifies a treatment that <i>promotes</i> growth.
        </p>
        <center><img src="images/GR_curve_annotated.png" align="center" height="250px" style="padding-bottom:10px;"></center>
        <p>
          GR values are used to fit a logistic dose-response curve where the x-axis is the log treatment concentration. We
          constrain the upper asymptote of the curve to a value of 1 because we would expect no change in growth rate for extremely low concentrations. GR values greater than one are allowed, but we constrain the fitted curve to less
          than one since we focus on growth-inhibiting and cytotoxic treatments. For treatments that promote growth, and for treatments that poorly fit a logistic curve, we fit a flat horizontal line.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just like percent viability curves, GR curves can be summarized by a number of metrics. In place of <b><i>IC<sub>50</sub></i></b>, the measure of concentration that gives 50% relative viability, we report <b><i>GR<sub>50</sub></i></b>, the concentration at which growth is reduced by 50% (where the GR curve intersects 0.5). In place of <b><i>E<sub>inf</sub></i></b>, the lower asymptote of the relative viability curve (the maximal theoretical drug effect), we report <b><i>GR<sub>inf</sub></i></b>, the lower asymptote of the GR curve. And so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditional summary statistics of the relative viability curve include

        <p>
          <center>
          <b><i>IC<sub>50</sub></i></b>, <b><i>E<sub>inf</sub></i></b>, <b><i>E<sub>max</sub></i></b>,<b><i>EC<sub>50</sub></i></b>, <b><i>h</i></b> (the Hill coefficient), and <b><i>AUC</i></b> (area under the curve).
          </center>
        </p>
        <p>
          We report analagous statistics for each GR curve

      In order to differentiate between the effects of slowed division and cell death, we introduce the static and toxic GR. We start by modifying our model of cell population growth to separate total population growth rate into two parts, a division rate <b><i>k<sub>s</sub></i></b> and a death rate <b><i>k<sub>d</sub></i></b>.

    <p>
      To derive these, we describe the rates of change with a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):
      <center><img src="images/gr_diffeq.png" align = "center" height="150px" style="padding-bottom:10px;"></center>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the initial conditions for the population of live cells <b><i>x<sub>0</sub> = x(0,0)</i></b> and dead cells <b><i>d<sub>0</sub> = d(0,0)</i></b>, we solve this system for <b><i>k<sub>s</sub></i></b> and <b><i>k<sub>d</sub></i></b>.
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/gr_diffeq_sol.png" align = "center" height="300px" style="padding-bottom:10px;"></center>
    <p>
      For <font color="light blue"><b>GR<sub>static</sub></b></font>, the cytostatic part of growth-rate inhibition, we consider the ratio of the treated growth-rate among viable cells to the un-treated growth rate <b><i>k<sub>s</sub>(c)/k<sub>s</sub>(0)</i></b>. Again, we exponentiate it and subtract 1 to bound our values for the curve. Since <font color="light blue"><b>GR<sub>static</sub></b></font> only characterizes slowed population growth and not cell death, it is bounded between 1 and 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <font color="red"><b>GR<sub>toxic</sub></b></font>, we expect the un-treated death rate <b><i>k<sub>d</sub>(0)</i></b> to be close to zero, so to make a more robust measure we use the difference of the death rates <b><i>k<sub>d</sub>(0) - k<sub>d</sub>(c)</i></b> rather than their ratio. As with <font color="light blue"><b>GR<sub>static</sub></b></font>, we exponentiate and subtract 1. This makes it so that <font color="red"><b>GR<sub>toxic</sub></b></font> is bounded between 0 and -1.
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/gr_vs_gr_sd.png" align = "center" height="275px" style="padding-bottom:10px;"></center>
    <p>
      As with the original GR method, we fit logistic curves to model the <font color="light blue"><b>GR<sub>static</sub></b></font> and <font color="red"><b>GR<sub>toxic</sub></b></font> values as a function of the log treatment concentration.

    <p>
      As with the original GR curves, we extract summary metrics from the <font color="light blue"><b>GR<sub>static</sub></b></font> and <font color="red"><b>GR<sub>toxic</sub></b></font> curves such as <b><i>GR<sub>50</sub></i></b>, <b><i>GR<sub>inf</sub></i></b>, <b><i>GR<sub>AOC</sub></i></b>, etc. These metrics summarize the growth response of the viable and dead cell populations, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these parameters are defined in the same was as for the original GR curves, with a few small changes. Since the <font color="red"><b>GR<sub>toxic</sub></b></font> curve is bounded between 0 and -1, its <b><i>GR<sub>50</sub></i></b> is defined as the concentration at which it crosses the y = -0.5 line. Similarly, it's <b><i>GR<sub>AOC</sub></i></b> value is defined as the area above the curve, but below zero.

      <p>
        In the original growth-response inhibition (GR) model, GR values are fitted to a 3-parameter sigmoidal curve.
        This models a situation in which the dose-response effect of a perturbagen starts as exponential at lower concentrations and, as concentration increases, reduces to linear and then finally levels off as the effect saturates at higher concentrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GR curve has a lower asymptote, <b><i>GR<sub>inf</sub></i></b>, which models the maximum effect, <b><i>GEC<sub>50</sub></i></b>, the concentration of the curve's inflection point, and <b><i>h<sub>GR</sub></i></b>, the steepness of the curve.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in some cases cell response may be better modeled by two "phases" of growth inhibition, in which a perturbagen has two separate effects at lower and higher concentrations.
        In this update, we have added the option to fit a "biphasic" curve, which models growth-response separately at lower and higher concentrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this curve, we fit six parameters. The part of the curve at lower concentrations has one set of parameters (<b><i>GR<sub>inf</sub></i></b>, <b><i>GEC<sub>50</sub></i></b>, and <b><i>h<sub>GR</sub></i></b>), while the part of the curve at higher concentrations has another.
